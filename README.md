# SDD_Major_Work
Here is my Software Major Project - A chemical reaction simulator

## User Manual/Program Features

#### Primary Features

The user can:
1. Search and add chemicals to the reaction
2. React simple chemical reaction based on the inputted reactions
3. Perform unit conversions on the chemicals resulting from the reaction

#### User Manual

To get the user manual, go to the github page

#### Extra Features

Planned Extra features:
- Equilibrium reactions
- Further orgainic molecule reactions
- Acid/Base reactions
