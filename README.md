Here is my Software Major Project - A chemical reaction simulator

## User Manual

### Basic Information

The Reactit! Calculator's goal is to provide an easier way of calculating basic chemical reactions for high school and university students. It will require prior knowlege to be able to operate, hence the target audience, however, it can help individual learning especially for those in Years 10 and 11. A majority of the reactions as well as the information accesible from the program will be geared towards New South Wales Preliminary/HSC Chemistry.

### Anticipated FAQs

These are most likely the questions that could be frequenty asked when figuring out problems and issues with this program.

**Why can I only select a limited amount of chemicals?**

You can only do such because of the complexity of reactions that are allowed. Trying to include all chemicals known to man can be a daunting task and it is better to worry about conducting the research on the most commonly occuring ones.

**Why is the reaction button not working?**

The problem may come from the following sources:
- You inputted is incalculable, try making sure the right chemicals such as catalysts or water are included
- The reaction is not in the program's database due to similar reasons in the questions above
- The mole ratioes of the inputted reaction are too high, meaning that the program will call it quits before the numbers can be produced

**Where are the imperial units?**

We use metric units only because this is a scientific tool. And this has been developed in Australia.

**How precise are the constants used?**

The constants are kept to 4 significant figures (i.e. Ideal Gas Constant). For other information pertaining to individual chemicals, it can vary depending on what can be dug up online.

### GUI Help

This section is currently empty as a GUI has not been developed yet

### Reactions

The reaction button contains most of the mahic of the program. The way it works is in a few simple steps:

1. Find the type of reaction (i.e. Combustion, Harber Process etc.)
2. Assign the products based on the type (e.g. complete hydrocarbon combustion reactions produce water and carbon dioxide)
3. Equalize both sides of the reaction
4. Calculate any necessary amount values
5. Extra feature values such as equilibria or acid/base

### Extra Features

Planned Extra features:
- Equilibrium reactions
- Further orgainic molecule reactions
- Acid/Base reactions
